# Nitrogen
A Pygame ModernGL topdown multiplayer survival game.

This game is still in development.

If you want to play, you can try to run the portable version.
The `Nitrogen.dist` folder has everything you need to run the game.
On Windows just run the binary at `Nitrogen.dist/Nitrogen.exe`.

On other platforms you can run the source code `Nitrogen.py` with your own python environment.
You should use pygame 2.1.2 (SDL 2.0.18, Python 3.9.9) with the modules found in `requirements.txt`:

For easy install do `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Your system needs OpenGL 330 or greater.

Source code has been tested on Windows 10/11 (AMD/Nvidia graphics), macOS Catalina (Intel graphics), and Arch Linux (AMD graphics).
