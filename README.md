Pygame ModernGL 2D game

This game is still in development.

If you want to play, you can try to run the portable version.
The `main.dist` folder has everything you need to run the game.
On Windows just run the binary at `main.dist/main.exe`.

On other platforms you can either run the binary using Wine, or run the source code `main.py` with your own python environment.
You should use pygame 2.0.3 (SDL 2.0.16, Python 3.9.9) with the following modules:

* pygame
* PIL / PILLOW
* pickle
* cProfile
* struct
* moderngl
* glcontext
* base64

You will also need OpenGL.
