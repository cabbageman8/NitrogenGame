Pygame ModernGL 2D game

This game is still in development.

If you want to play, you can try to run the portable version.
The `main.dist` folder has everything you need to run the game (only on windows).
Just run the binary at `main.dist/main.exe`

On other platforms you will need to run the source code `main.py`, meaning you must set up your own python environment.
You should use pygame 2.0.3 (SDL 2.0.16, Python 3.9.9) with the following modules:

pygame
PIL / PILLOW
pickle
math
cProfile
sys
os
struct
moderngl
glcontext

You will also need OpenGL.
